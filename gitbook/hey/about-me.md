# ðŸ”Ž About Me

Hello! I'm Kaiser, a Year 3 Student at the National University of Singapore. I study Data Science, and I will be graduating in 2026.\
\
I was born and raised in California, spending grade school under the [GATES Program](https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/gt/) until I moved to Singapore when I was 9. I had a lot of different interests back then, too. I wanted to be a writer, a marine biologist, a filmmaker, and at one point I wanted to become a material scientist that would help people on Mars build houses out of martian soil (Go Mark Watney).  As a kid, my parents and teachers said I was "bouncing off the walls". Now, I _do_ bounce off the walls: I'm not very good at it, but I quite like bouldering. I also make an attempt to maintain my [Medium blog.](https://medium.com/@kaijche)&#x20;

I have always liked arts, psychology and philosophy, and disliked _doing_ math. Here I am studying data science, of all things.&#x20;

But once I discovered LLMs and foundation models, it's all I want to explore. Here we are with the best emulation of human thought that we have seen. Why isn't everyone else working on this? With every advancement in deep learning, we get closer to figuring out how we ourselves think.  I think that's pretty cool and worth spending time on.&#x20;

There's a theory that language was the most important development in our history to achieve higher-level thinking. I see it as a way for individuals to pool their knowledge; and if its true all the way up, from neurons to peoples to communities to ecosystems rely on connections to allow the whole to be greater than the parts, then it's worth a try to make language models the foundation for the next wave of human development.&#x20;

I don't think that AGI will happen in the next decade. See[ this article ](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web)by one of my favorite writers, Ted Chiang. But I am curious when, instead of evolving _into_ language, we use it as a basis for cognition.&#x20;

But just to be safe, be nice to the chatbots, [and don't look up Roko's Basilisk. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko's\_basilisk)
