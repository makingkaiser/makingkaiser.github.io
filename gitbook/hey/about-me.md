# ðŸ”Ž About Me

Hello! I'm Kaiser, a Year 3 Student at the National University of Singapore. I study Data Science, and I will be graduating in 2026.\
\
I was born in the States, and lived in Davis, California, spending 2 years of grade school under the [GATES Program](https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/gt/) until I moved to Singapore when I was 9. I wanted to be a writer, a marine biologist, a filmmaker, and at one point I wanted to become a material scientist that would help the first people on mars build houses out of the martian soil (Go Mark Watney).  As a kid, my parents and teachers would describe me as someone who was bouncing off the walls. And now, I _do_ bounce off the walls. I'm not very good at it, but I quite like bouldering. I also make an attempt to maintain my [Medium blog.](https://medium.com/@kaijche)&#x20;

I have always been more inclined towards the arts, psychology and philosophy, and disliked _doing_ math. Here I am studying data science, of all things.&#x20;

But once I discovered LLMs and foundation models, it's all I want to explore. Not to mention that the parallels to cognition means that with every advancement in deep learning, we get closer to understanding the human brain.  I think that's a pretty cool pursuit, and something worth doing.&#x20;

There's a theory that language was the most important development in our history to achieve higher-level thinking. Put simply it's a way for people to pool their knowledge; it's not surprising that all complex forms of living things, be it neurons, communities or ecosystems, rely on connections to allow the whole to be greater than the parts.&#x20;

I don't think that AGI will happen in the next decade. See[ this article ](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web)by one of my favorite writers, Ted Chiang. But I do want to see what happens when, instead of evolving _into_ language, we use it as a basis for cognition.&#x20;

But just to be safe, be nice to the chatbots, [and don't look up Roko's Basilisk. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko's\_basilisk)
