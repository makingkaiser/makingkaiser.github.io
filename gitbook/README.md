# üê¶ Hey!

These are some of my notes on LLMs and ML that I have collected along the way. They serve as a way to collate my understanding of the field, and also as a portfolio of sorts. \
Included among them are also some of my thoughts on this new age of language-based compute. I hope you find some things useful to you!&#x20;
